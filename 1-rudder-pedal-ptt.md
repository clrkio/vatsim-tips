# Using rudder pedals as dual push-to-talk pedals

When acting as an Air Traffic Controller on VATSIM, it's useful to be able to type while talking on the radio.
This is difficult if the push-to-talk (PTT) key is on the keyboard, especially if the PTT key is a special key, like CTRL or SHIFT, which changes the meaning of other keyboard keys.
It would be great to be able to use your feet to activate the PTT, while using your hands to type on the keyboard.
Many people use external pedals like [these](https://www.delcomproducts.com/webpage.asp?id=32), but they can be expensive and take up space.
On the other hand, many ATCs on VATSIM are virtual pilots as well, and often own rudder pedals as part of their simulation gear.
This tip will show you how to use those rudder pedals as dual push-to-talk pedals when controlling on the network.
